<h2>Ellie's Quest Rebirth</h2>

<p>This is a redo of my final project for Rockit Bootcamp where I made a final fantasy like turn based rpg with javascript and backbone.  I have since learned React and would like to try to rewrite this using react.  Feel free to clone, fork, hit me up, or do some pull requests.  I want to do this and then actually turn this into a nice working game:)</p>
